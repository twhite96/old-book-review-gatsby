I think I liked Lenny as a character more than anyone in this book. His slowness really appealed to me as I’ve known some people like that. Maybe my opinion is biased based on this, but it really was a good book, very sad. It was a breeze to read and a little too light to me, considering the plot of the book. The ending was the saddest part. I’d recommend this book for someone looking for a quick, light, heartbreaking read.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>"}

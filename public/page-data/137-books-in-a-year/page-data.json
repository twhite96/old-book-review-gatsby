Hendricks</a>\nMy rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1569908347\">3 of 5 stars</a></p>\n<p>Practical advice is practical.</p>\n<p>He failed to mention audiobooks in the heart of the book, instead adding it to the Appendix. I thought it was worth more of an exposè. Considering this book was written in 2013 or so, I’m pretty certain Audible was an Amazon company by then and audiobooks were more mainstream.</p>\n<p>In any case, the advice was solid, the book didn’t cost a lot. Decent read.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/reading/","/tags/kevin-d-hendricks/","/tags/2016/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"137 Books in One Year Review: How to Write a Book for Cash","tags":["reading","kevin d. hendricks","2016","goodreads"],"date":"2016-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Practical advice is practical.

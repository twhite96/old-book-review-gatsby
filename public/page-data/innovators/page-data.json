The libertarian slant of the digital movement in the 1960s-70s was interesting as well and counter to what I thought about tech innovators from that time. The Whole Earth Movement is something I want to research, as covers it here but not in-depthâ€” just enough to give you a sense of the people behind the movement.</p>\n<p>The narration was good. The content very interesting and kept my attention more so than other books on the topic. Definitely a favorite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/technology/","/tags/apple/","/tags/microsoft/","/tags/steve-jobs/","/tags/bill-gates/","/tags/walter-isaacson/","/tags/goodreads/","/tags/2016/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution ","tags":["technology","apple","microsoft","steve jobs","bill gates","walter isaacson","goodreads","2016"],"date":"2016-01-03","description":"A long listen but sweeping history of the technologies we use today"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/innovators/"}}}

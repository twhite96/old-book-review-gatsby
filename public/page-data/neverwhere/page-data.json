The darkness of the “fairytale” was well written and in a sci-fi sort of way, believable. I was drawn to Door as a character, not so much Richard, though. I did feel bad for him but that’s about it. He seemed like the sniveling type. I liked him just a little bit, not as much as I had liked to. On the whole, I thought this was a great book- I don’t read much sci-fi, but I will read Gaiman. Loved this book. Didn’t want to put it down.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/fantasy/","/tags/2009/","/tags/neil-gaiman/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Neverwhere: A Great Intro to Gaiman's Work","tags":["fantasy","2009","neil gaiman","goodreads"],"date":"2009-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","description":"I don't read much sci-fi, but I will read Gaiman."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/neverwhere/"}}}

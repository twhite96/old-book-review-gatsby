I am not sure why Steven included Jobs— he was more of a businessman and showman than an engineer and it showed in his work. He asked Woz to finish a project for him at Atari. Not the hacker type but if you’re going to dedicate a couple hours of the book on Apple Computer, it makes sense to include him. It also inspired me, as a new, self-taught engineer, to rethink math. I was really good at it but things delayed my learning, as well as being an arrogant teenager full of herself. I have since looked at Bézier functions and have downloaded a few KU calc books.</p>\n<p>If you’d like insights on geeky geniuses who have literally shaped the world today, give it a listen/read. Not all of them are likeable (Richard Stallman) but their quirks are endearing, if you’re the geeky, introverted type. 5 stars because I am into that sort of thing and Levy does a good job of cleaning up his earlier mistakes. I wish he would have maybe cut some of the main part of the book to include more about today’s hackers but still, a great read. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1576869358\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/apple/","/tags/steve-jobs/","/tags/microsoft/","/tags/bill-gates/","/tags/2016/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Review: Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, 25th Anniversary Edition","tags":["apple","steve jobs","microsoft","bill gates","2016","goodreads"],"date":"2016-03-20","description":"A rag tag group of young kids from the west coast create the technology that shapes our world today."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hackers-review/"}}}

The writing is sure, determined and the subject of the Collyer brothers who died in their own home after “collecting” tons of junk, so as they couldn’t really be mobile, is fascinating. It is a real, true story of hoarding from the 1940’s and it is painted with a deft hand. We get a glimpse of Homer, the blind brother in the narration, Langley, the more mobile brother, the narrator who is trying to save them, tell their story but realizes he is inept at doing so, and the investigators who find the bodies. This novella is rare in that you can feel the tension and emotion behind the veil of distance that Matt creates with his writing. Sure, sure handed writing. 5*s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/novellas/","/tags/2011/","/tags/matt-bell/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Collectors Review","tags":["novellas","2011","matt bell","goodreads"],"date":"2011-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"This novella captured my attention from the first page and never let go of it."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/the-collectors/"}}}

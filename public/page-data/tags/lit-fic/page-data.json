Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/undefined/","categorySlug":"/categories/literary-fiction/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Review Of Mice and Men","date":"2009-01-08","category":"Literary Fiction","description":"They are an unlikely pair: George is 'small and quick and dark of face'; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"lit fic"}}}

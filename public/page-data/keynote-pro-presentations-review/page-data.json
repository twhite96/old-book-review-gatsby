The author made some pretty complicated vectors with Keynote that I could do in Affinity Designer of Sketch more intuitively. But if you don’t have experience with design software, try to look up the exact photos or vectors you need online, which will save a lot of time.</p>\n<p>For beginners and and Intermediate Keynote users this is a great book. I’m certain advanced users have this stuff down.</p>\n<p>4 stars for the quality of the information and the exercise files. One star off for text formatting issues.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1579146369\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/apps/","/tags/apple/","/tags/2016/","/tags/keynote/","/tags/angelo-spiler/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Keynote, Professional Presentations and Animations","tags":["apps","apple","2016","keynote","angelo spiler","goodreads"],"date":"2016-04-03","description":"This book is a great primer on Keynote, Apple's answer to PowerPoint."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/keynote-pro-presentations-review/"}}}

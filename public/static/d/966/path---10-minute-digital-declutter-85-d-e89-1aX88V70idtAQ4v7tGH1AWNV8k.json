Scott</a>\nMy rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1581991239\">2 of 5 stars</a></p>\n<p>This book, although written in 2015, is outdated. By a lot.</p>\n<p>Most everyone does these things. Backups, unique passwords. I don’t know who this book is for if I’m being honest.</p>\n<p>As a programmer I read maybe 1/3 of this book and skimmed the rest.</p>\n<p>Also as someone mentioned this is PC heavy. Most of these tasks I automate on my Mac with third party apps that, with my rules, will file, rename, move, tag, copy, sync, and delete files with specific parameters I set, for instance any photo in my downloads folder gets moved to my pictures folder. Any disk image in my downloads folder older than a week gets put in the Trash. When my trash is 2gb in size it is emptied automatically, etc.</p>\n<p>These are the things we can do now. This book is for your grandma who doesn’t understand what technology is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/productivity/","/tags/health-and-wellness/","/tags/s-j-scott/","/tags/2019/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"10 Minute Digital Declutter, a Book for Grandma","tags":["productivity","health and wellness","s.j. scott","2019","goodreads"],"date":"2019-01-09","description":"This book, although written in 2015, is outdated.

I gave it 3 stars because I found Gregor’s family to be the most self-serving insects on earth!!! I felt so bad for Gregor, after the apple in the back. And I really, REALLY couldn’t stand his father and after a while his sister made me SICK!!! I know it was necessary to show that Gregor wasn’t a part of the family anymore because of some condition (it is said to be the self-inflicted condition of being a writer so I don’t feel bad for Kafka- he could have given it up) and isolation and whatever but his family just really, really irked me otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. But even so, Kafka was a twisted genius.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/kafka/","/tags/allegory/","/tags/2009/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Metamorphosis: Flawed, But Interesting Read","tags":["kafka","allegory","2009","goodreads"],"date":"2009-04-17","description":"A review of this book by a much younger, much less jaded me."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/metamorphosis/"}}

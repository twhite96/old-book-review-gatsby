Covey</a>\nMy rating: <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1561965014\">1 of 5 stars</a></p>\n<p>Synergy is a terrible buzzword.</p>\n<p>I listened to a few chapters and decided this kind of “wisdom” really wasn’t wisdom at all, just prepackaged, pre-Deepak Chopra nonsense.</p>\n<p>But Stephen Covey is the man for keeping this machine running, even after his death with The 5 Choices, a reboot of this tripe for the digital age with three annoying narrators and a truckload of shite.</p>\n<p>$$$$$$. That’s what this book is about.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1940314-tiffany\">View all my reviews</a></p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/business/","/tags/guru-bullshit/","/tags/hippy-dippy-woo-woo/","/tags/stephen-covey/","/tags/2016/","/tags/goodreads/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Synergy...and...Stuff: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People","tags":["business","guru bullshit","hippy dippy woo woo","stephen covey","2016","goodreads"],"date":"2016-02-26","description":"Synergy is a terrible buzzword."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/seven-habits-review/"}}

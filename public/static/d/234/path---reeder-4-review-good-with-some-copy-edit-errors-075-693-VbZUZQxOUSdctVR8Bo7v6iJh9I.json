It goes over why he likes Reeder, the different views, styling, and advanced features.</p>\n<p>The thing I liked most was the explanation of his reading workflow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For me, using Reeder lets me efficiently process my incoming stories, either from the list view or by jumping down through each full story, giving a fantastic flow to the experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve set it up for my RSS feeds synced via Feedly and articles I’ve saved for later in Instapaper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is great but then he explains further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once I’ve saved the stories I want to read, I then jump into the Instapaper view and go through any links I’ve added that don’t necessarily work great as “read it later” articles. Any Amazon links or YouTube videos I will tend to shoot off to Reading List to easily process in Safari, making this fall out into a sort of three-tier system:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Feedly for incoming feeds</li>\n<li>Instapaper for reading later</li>\n<li>Reading List for non-article links</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then, I usually have a minimal amount of stories to read and I come back to them when I’m ready, either right away in Reeder or later in Instapaper, and with Shortcuts ready to go if I’m in my Reading List in Safari.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is great because I have a considerable amount of articles I need to read and process whether it is for things I’d like to write about or reference later. This gives me some inspiration and something to think about.</p>\n<h2>Issues</h2>\n<p>There are some minor copy errors and style issues but since this is a free book made from an article, it doesn’t bother me too much. Still, it might bother someone, somewhere, on the internet.</p>\n<h2>3 Stars</h2>\n<p>If you’re a nerd, journalist/writer, or any other person looking to get their news from RSS and need an RSS reader that is as customizable as it is beautiful, Reeder 4 is your app and Matt’s book will help you get the most out of it.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/2019/","/tags/reeder-4-review/","/tags/matt-cassinelli/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reeder 4 Review: Good with Some Copy Errors","tags":["2019","Reeder 4 review","Matt Cassinelli"],"date":"2019-08-15","description":"Good little ebook on my favorite RSS reader."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/reeder-4-review-good-with-some-copy-edit-errors/"}}

I'm Tiffany and I like books.

You can find various book reviews from me, whether programming books, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, business, productivity, and other non-fiction, right here.

I was going to use [Tiffany R. White Blog](https://tiffanywhite.dev), my programming blog to host these reviews but I decided that would just clutter everything up over there.

So they reside here.

You can find me to chat about books at the places on the sidebar or you can [check me out on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/sydmalicious78) and [MobileRead Forums](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/member.php?u=240004).

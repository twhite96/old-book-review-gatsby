My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1493668229)

A long listen but sweeping history of the technologies we use today, from Ada Lovelace (great background on her, a fair treatment without much bias from either her detractors or admirers) to Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin and Larry Page and even Ev Williams, who founded Blogger, Medium, and co-founded Twitter.

I found the histories of Turing (I had heard of Alan Turing briefly and know of the Turing test but did not know much about him), Babbage, Case, and the like interesting. The libertarian slant of the digital movement in the 1960s-70s was interesting as well and counter to what I thought about tech innovators from that time. The Whole Earth Movement is something I want to research, as covers it here but not in-depth-- just enough to give you a sense of the people behind the movement.

The narration was good. The content very interesting and kept my attention more so than other books on the topic. Definitely a favorite.

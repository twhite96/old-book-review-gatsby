[![SMART Goals: Simplified - Make Your Personal And Career Goals A Reality (Personal Goals, Career Goals,)](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1430066032m/25432172.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25432172-smart-goals)[SMART Goals: Simplified - Make Your Personal And Career Goals A Reality](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25432172-smart-goals) by [C.J. Rodwell](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13450184.C_J_Rodwell)
My rating: [1 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1283134531)

This book is poorly written and in terrible need of a competent editor.

Example:

"The first one is personal goals and the second category is career goals. Personal goals are what the individual wants to achieve in his/her personal life. A personal goal is what the individual wants in life."

Repetition of this sort irks me. First of all, personal goal is self explanatory. Then you repeat the same idea twice, one sentence right after the other. This is just one instance.

As far as the "free limited time video"â€” it's a YouTube video. Really. How is this used to promote a book? It's not even the author's content.

Horrible. Read it in 10 minutes. Returning the KU book and never downloading another from this author again.

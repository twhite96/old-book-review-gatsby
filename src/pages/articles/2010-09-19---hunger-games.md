My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/118909090)

I loved the pacing of this book. That is first and foremost. Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist, is flawed in a very believable way and it is obvious she is 16. That Collins has written her so believably, with her plethora of flaws, her confusion about Peeta and Gale, her weirdness towards her mother...as a writer I only hope to capture that in my literary YA novel. My problem with the book is not the content as much as it is reading it on the first go around as writer, noting every technique, disagreeing with how she drops conflicts so clunkily in the plot and resolves them the same way. When I read it as a writer it did not seem seamless, and maybe that is because I was reading it critically more so than to enjoy it. Maybe I am off in this assumption, but I feel it, I can see it in her prose. As far as the story goes (trying to weed out my writer instincts) I'm hooked. I'm reading _Catching Fire now._

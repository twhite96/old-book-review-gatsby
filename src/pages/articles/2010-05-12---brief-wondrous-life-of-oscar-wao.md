My rating: [5 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/74007027)

I rarely give a book five stars but as a writer I just had to. I loved the narrator's voice. Yunior had a distinct, urban Spanglish, of today's generation that just absolutely blew me away. Oscar was a lovably morose character and his nerdiness appealed to me because in junior high I had a thing for science fiction novels, I was a habitual writer, and I played video games like non-stop. So Oscar appealed to me on many levels.

Beli's story really resonated with me as well. When she was young...gosh, her struggle just...WOW.

I appreciated the down to earth personalities of each of the characters in this book (except the older Beli) and their honesty as well. The only bad thing about this book for me were the constant foot notes Diaz used. They were necessary but distracting. As a writer, I would have probably done the same thing but then again I would have struggled to pull this kind of novel off. Great piece of lit fic. Do read, if you have the patience.

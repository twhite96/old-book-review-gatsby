[![The Metamorphosis](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1359061917m/485894.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis)[The Metamorphosis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485894.The_Metamorphosis) by [Franz Kafka](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5223.Franz_Kafka)
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/50763545)

I gave this book 3 stars not because of Kafka's writing or because I thought it was flawed in style. I gave it 3 stars because I found Gregor's family to be the most self-serving insects on earth!!! I felt so bad for Gregor, after the apple in the back. And I really, REALLY couldn't stand his father and after a while his sister made me SICK!!! I know it was necessary to show that Gregor wasn't a part of the family anymore because of some condition (it is said to be the self-inflicted condition of being a writer so I don't feel bad for Kafka- he could have given it up) and isolation and whatever but his family just really, really irked me otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. But even so, Kafka was a twisted genius.

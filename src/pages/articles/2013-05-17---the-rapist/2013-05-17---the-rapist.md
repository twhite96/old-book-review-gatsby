[![The Rapist](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1361744720m/17322002.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17322002-the-rapist)[The Rapist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17322002-the-rapist) by [Les Edgerton](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/212322.Les_Edgerton)
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/616707289)

Speechless. The ending left me speechless. In between I felt like I was being taught Intro to Philosophy, there were points in the book where I felt Les could have worked the philosophy in a bit more subtly. But the ending. Wow. I was originally going to give the book three stars but the ending saved it from being mediocre. It was gripping and quick, Truman made me think on more than one occasion on on different philosophical and social platitudes than I am used to. Pick it up. It might surprise you.

My rating: [1 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2168947523)

Do the Work is honestly the worst book I’ve ever read. Worse than The Charge. 👎🏽💩

It was 55 ebook pages of new age hippy garbage. Quote: “Bad things happen when we employ rational thought because rational thought comes from the ego“. In this day and age we need all the rational thought we can muster. What the everloving f*ck….

This book was full of Buddhist platitudes and trite motivational rah rah BS. I honestly don’t know why it’s so highly recommended.

My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/430421108)

This book isn't for everyone. It moves in clips and broken pieces that thread together haphazardly but in a beautiful way. Some of the clips are just heartbreakingly beautiful, some made me laugh, others I had to reread because they were so profound. Because of the repetition of certain sentence elements or words, because of the switching between 1st and 3rd person (there is even some second person in there), a lot of readers will be thinking "wtf?". I'd urge those readers to stick it out. There are real gems hidden in those clips, just need the time and space and freedom to think about each, digest them separately, then piece them all together, like a delicate patchwork of beautifully domestic ideas.

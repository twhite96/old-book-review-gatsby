Covey](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1538.Stephen_R_Covey)
My rating: [1 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1561965014)

Synergy is a terrible buzzword.

I listened to a few chapters and decided this kind of "wisdom" really wasn't wisdom at all, just prepackaged, pre-Deepak Chopra nonsense.

But Stephen Covey is the man for keeping this machine running, even after his death with The 5 Choices, a reboot of this tripe for the digital age with three annoying narrators and a truckload of shite.

$$$$$$. That's what this book is about.

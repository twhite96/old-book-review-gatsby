My rating: [2 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1581991239)

This book, although written in 2015, is outdated. By a lot.

Most everyone does these things. Backups, unique passwords. I don’t know who this book is for if I’m being honest.

As a programmer I read maybe 1/3 of this book and skimmed the rest.

Also as someone mentioned this is PC heavy. Most of these tasks I automate on my Mac with third party apps that, with my rules, will file, rename, move, tag, copy, sync, and delete files with specific parameters I set, for instance any photo in my downloads folder gets moved to my pictures folder. Any disk image in my downloads folder older than a week gets put in the Trash. When my trash is 2gb in size it is emptied automatically, etc.

These are the things we can do now. This book is for your grandma who doesn’t understand what technology is.

[![Neverwhere](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1334771048m/474072.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474072.Neverwhere)[Neverwhere](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/474072.Neverwhere) by [Neil Gaiman](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman)
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/52207923)

I really really loved this book. The darkness of the "fairytale" was well written and in a sci-fi sort of way, believable. I was drawn to Door as a character, not so much Richard, though. I did feel bad for him but that's about it. He seemed like the sniveling type. I liked him just a little bit, not as much as I had liked to. On the whole, I thought this was a great book- I don't read much sci-fi, but I will read Gaiman. Loved this book. Didn't want to put it down.

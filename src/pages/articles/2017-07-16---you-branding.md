[![You Branding: Reinventing Your Personal Identity as a Successful Brand](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389662023m/20528517.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20528517-you-branding)[You Branding: Reinventing Your Personal Identity as a Successful Brand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20528517-you-branding) by [Mark Cijo](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7762607.Mark_Cijo)
My rating: [2 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2026883366)

There were bits and pieces in here I could really get behind as someone sort of new to personal branding (totally different field however). SWOT and other terms were really helpful and new.

With that said, most of the information in this book can be read on blogs around this topic and most of the content in this book is not new.

Good book for true beginners and intermediate bloggers alike. Get on Kindle Unlimited so you don't have to pay separately.

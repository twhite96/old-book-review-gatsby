This book reads like a stream of consciousness diary entry from a teenaged girl who is depressed and on the verge of suicide; it was extremely hard to read.

It was a quick read, not a light-hearted romp, and ultimately made me feel really, really uncomfortable.

I really hope the author got the help she needed.

![](./1.png)

This book isn't so much of a handbook as it is a collection of resources. It is a bit opinionated; Cody's view on frontend software development these days is a jaded one and with good reason. I'd have preferred if his bias would have been left out of the book.

## Resources

The resources were basically a bunch of blog posts and documentation. I downloaded the epub and that isn't the best way to read this book. Bookmark it in your browser and refer to the abundance of links at your leisure.

2 stars.
